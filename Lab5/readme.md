# Lab 5: Digital Systems Design  
  
**Name:** Fatima Irfan Sohail  
**Reg. No.:** 2023-EE-155  

## Overview  
This lab focuses on implementing a seven-segment display using truth tables, Karnaugh maps (K-maps), and FPGA-based design using Vivado. The report contains the necessary logic derivations, simulations, FPGA implementation, and delay analysis.  

### Task 1: Truth Tables  
- **Cathode Truth Table:** Defines the activation of segments (a-g) for input values 0-F.  
- **Anode Truth Table:** Defines the selection logic for seven-segment display activation.  

### Task 2: Karnaugh Maps and Boolean Equations  
- K-maps were used to simplify the logic for each segment (A-G).  
- Boolean expressions were derived for each segment.  

### Task 3: Logical Implementation  
- Boolean equations were implemented using logic gates.  

### Task 4: FPGA Circuit Design  
- **Vivado Circuit Diagrams:**  
  - Circuit diagram for cathode control.  
  - Circuit diagram for anode control.  

### Task 5 & 6: Timing Analysis  
- **Maximum Combinational Delay (Cathode):** 6.805 ns  
- **Maximum Combinational Delay (Anode):** 12.169 ns
